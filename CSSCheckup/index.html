    <h3>Here's a great way to connect with people in your life.</h3>
    <p>Getting outdoors is great for your body and mind. That body and mind is amplified when you get outdoors with people you care about. It could be something as simple as taking a walk around your neighborhood, standing in your yard barefoot, or even sitting by an open window to let the breeze in and look at nature. If you prefer intensity, then go for a hike, kayak down the river or on a lake. Challenge your friends/family on a scavenger hunt. As the saying goes, "The more the merrier", getting outside to engage in fun activities with a group can be oodles and buckets of fun.</p>
